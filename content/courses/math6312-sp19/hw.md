The homework problems will be assigned weekly on the course webpage, and the problems will be supplemented with computer assignments requiring the use of statistical software (R). Statistical software instructions will be provided as needed.

There will be 7 homework assignments and a final homework assignment. One lowest homework score will be dropped, but you cannot drop the final homework. Late coursework will not be accepted without a university approved excuse. It is imperative that you show all your work; simply stating an answer will result in no credit for the problem. You are encouraged to work with each other on the homework problems, but you must turn in your own work.
