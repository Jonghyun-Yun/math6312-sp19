## Course Content {#math6312-sp19-course-content}

Data mining is the process of exploring and analyzing, by automatic or semiautomatic means, large quantities of observational data in order to discover meaningful patterns and models. By applying data mining techniques, data miners can fully exploit data patterns and behavior, gain insider understanding of the data, and produce new knowledge that decision-makers can act upon. Data mining has gained a substantial interest among practitioners in a variety of fields and industries. Nowadays, almost every organization collects data, which can be analyzed in order to support making better decisions, improving policies, discovering computer network intrusion patterns, designing new drugs, detecting credit fraud, making accurate medical diagnoses, etc.

The course covers selected portions of the textbook (ESL), with main focus on topics including but not limited to:

-   Supervised learning
    -   linear regression, logistic regression
    -   model assessment, validation, and regularization
    -   boosting; bagging and random forest
    -   support vector machine, generative/discriminative classification algorithm
    -   neural network, probabilistic graphical model

<!--listend-->

-   Unsupervised learning:
    -   cluster analysis
    -   principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling

The course will use R in order to demonstrate the implementation of data mining methods. In the first week, we will have a refresher on the commands in R which you will need to use in the following weeks, but this is not a comprehensive R course, and we will not go in depth on R syntax. Please see online R resources listed in the course website.

### Grade Distribution {#grade-distribution}

-   40% Homework assignments
-   20% Take-home midterm exam
-   40% Final project


### Document Formatting {#document-formatting}

All coursework (homework, midterm and final) must be turned in electronically, through Blackboard. All coursework will involve writing a combination of code and actual prose. You must submit your assignment in a format which allows for the combination of the two, and the automatic execution of all your code. The easiest way to do this is to use R Markdown. Exceptions may be made, with prior permission, for those who want to use other reproducible dynamic documents. Work should be submitted as R markdown **and** rendered PDF documents. Every files you submit should have a file name in the following format: `WorkType#.FirstName.LastName`.


### Homework {#homework}

The homework problems will be assigned weekly on the course webpage, and the problems will be supplemented with computer assignments requiring the use of statistical software (R). Statistical software instructions will be provided as needed.

There will be 7 homework assignments and a final homework assignment. One lowest homework score will be dropped, but you cannot drop the final homework. Late coursework will not be accepted without a university approved excuse. It is imperative that you show all your work; simply stating an answer will result in no credit for the problem. You are encouraged to work with each other on the homework problems, but you must turn in your own work.


### Final project {#final-project}

Students will make in-class presentations of their final projects at the end of semester. Students also need to submit their final project reports. The instructions for the final project will be announced in class.


## Digital Distractions {#digital-distractions}

You are encouraged to bring your mobile devices to class. Mobile devices are to be used only for purposes directly related to the class content and information. You may not view or respond to emails during class. You may not conduct unrelated searches during class. Cellphones should be turned to vibrate while in class and on silent or off when students are presenting. No phone calls should be accepted, only in case of an emergency.


## Lecture Attendance {#lecture-attendance}

At the University of Texas at Arlington, taking attendance is not required. Rather, each faculty member is free to develop his or her own methods of evaluating students' academic performance, which includes establishing course-specific policies on attendance. As the instructor of this section, I strongly encourage you to attend all lectures. You are responsible for any and all announcements made in class. You are also responsible for any material missed during class.


## Drop Policy {#drop-policy}

Students may drop or swap (adding and dropping a class concurrently) classes through self-service in MyMav from the beginning of the registration period through the late registration period. After the late registration period, students must see their academic advisor to drop a class or withdraw. Undeclared students must see an advisor in the University Advising Center. Drops can continue through a point two-thirds of the way through the term or session. It is the student's responsibility to officially withdraw if they do not plan to attend after registering. Students will not be automatically dropped for non-attendance. Repayment of certain types of financial aid administered through the University may be required as the result of dropping classes or withdrawing. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships (<http://wweb.uta.edu/aao/fao/>).
