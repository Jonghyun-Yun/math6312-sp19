## What you will learn {#what-you-will-learn}

-   understanding of fundamental data mining methodologies and with the
-   ability to formulate and solve practical problems.
-   practical, efficient and statistically sound techniques
-   providing not only the requested discoveries, but also estimates of their utility

The lectures will be complemented with hands-on experience with data mining software, primarily R, to allow development of basic execution skills.


## Target Audience {#target-audience}

The course is intended for entry-level graduate students who already have some basic background in Calculus, Probability & Statistics, and in Linear Algebra.
